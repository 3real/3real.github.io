This repository is for a static test website. At time of writting it hosts the learning outcomes of a Codeacademy tutorial.

## Getting Started

The scripts use javascript and html, they were written using sumblime. 

### Prerequisites

Prefered text editor
```

### Installing

Clone this repository locally.

Change the main.js and index.html script at will.

### Coding Snippets

The following ia the main body of the conditionals script

`````````
   <head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/hour-of-code/js/alphabet.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/hour-of-code/js/bubbles.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
  </body>

`````````
This head snippt from index.html is what references the bubble functions found in main.js that allow the text to wobble or bounce. These functions were not made by author.

`````````
var myName = "Mike";
var showBoat = "3real";
`````````
This snippet from main.js is where the variables for the words are placed
